I couldn't find a good resource for the soup-to-nuts process of buying a Model 3, so I made one. This is a comprehensive guide on preparing for, taking delivery of, and owning a Tesla Model 3.

## Start
Congratulations! You've configured a Model 3. Now comes the hardest part: waiting.

You'll receive an email from Tesla saying something to the effect of "We'll be in touch!" Do not get financing quotes at this time. Quotes expire after 30 days, at which time you will need to rerun the credit check, which may lower your score.

Depending on your financing choice during configuration, you'll see an "Edit Design" button on your account page all the way up until your car starts being built (this can be in as little as 7 days before taking delivery). If you elected to use the "Cash" option for financing, your "Edit Design" button will disappear immediately, but it is still accessible by visiting `https://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount/edit-design/RNXXXXXXX`. Use this link to (relatively) officially check the status of your order up to 7 days before your delivery date.

## First contact
You will eventually be contacted by a Tesla Delivery Advisor/Scheduler who will confirm your delivery date. Make sure your Tesla account reflects this date.

You'll want to get your home charging solution worked out at this point. There are many options depending on your needs:

| Level   | Voltage | Rate of Charge                                         |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | 120V    | 2-5 miles per hour of charging (regular outlet)        |
| Level 2 | 240V    | 9-52 miles per hour of charging ([Tesla Wall Connector](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector)) |
| Level 3 | 480V    | 200-1000 miles per hour of charging (Supercharging)    |

If you drive fewer than 70 miles per day, a regular wall outlet should be just fine. If you're driving more than that, and a Tesla Wall Connector will give you peace of mind. Many states offer a  [tax rebate](https://www.chargepoint.com/blog/electric-car-home-charger-rebates/) for the parts and labor of most charging solution installs.

Tesla has [a list of recommended installers](https://www.tesla.com/support/find-an-installer). Tesla partners with reputable local contractors to install the Wall Connector product in your home, but these contractors typically charge higher than average rates. Any experienced electrician should be able to do the work at a much lower price; it's a relatively simple job. You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMKiwyWikNs) to do a DIY installation.

## 30 days before your delivery date
Now is the time to get financing quotes from credit unions, banks, etc. Whatever quotes you get, if your credit history is excellent, use [Lightstream](https://www.lightstream.com/) to get an unsecured cash loan. They will beat any approved rate you send them.

Ensure you have the routing/account number of the account(s) you will be transferring funds from on delivery day (especially important on weekends when banks are closed).

You may also want to order your [accessories](https://shop.tesla.com/category/vehicle-accessories) now, as they are often sold out. Yes, it'll feel weird to have all weather floor mats with no car, but it'll be worth it in the end. Not sure what to get? See the "Must-Have Accessories" section in the appendix.

## 10 days before your delivery date
Your "Edit Design" button and/or back-door link should stop working and you should finalize your financeer at this time. If the link still works, your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

## 7 days before your delivery date
Check your Tesla account for an assigned Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement (MVPA). If they are not showing up, the back-door method is to try buying a [Tesla Wall Connector](https://shop.tesla.com/product/wall-connector). When you're checking out, if it says "No VIN assigned," you truly do not have a VIN. Your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

If you have a VIN assigned, call your insurance to schedule the coverage date for your delivery day.

## Anytime before delivery day, you should:
1.  Watch the [Model 3 walkthrough videos on the support section of Tesla.com](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-3-videos). These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process.
2.  Review the information supplied on the [Tesla Support pages](https://www.tesla.com/support?redirect=no), these pages go over details on financing, trade-ins, vehicle registration, insurance, warranty, etc.
3.  Attend a [Tesla owner orientation event](https://www.tesla.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with the car.
4.  [Download and read a copy of the owners manual](https://www.tesla.com/content/dam/tesla/Ownership/Own/Model%203%20Owners%20Manual.pdf). It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.
5.  Grab a [good tire inflator](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N224N1U?tag=mykelteslapre-20).
6.  Join the [official Tesla forum](https://forums.tesla.com/), the unofficial [Tesla Motors Club forum](https://teslamotorsclub.com/), and [r/teslamotors](http://reddit.com/r/teslamotors) subreddit.

## Delivery day
### Before heading to the Delivery Center:
If you haven't had any contact with a Delivery Advisor/Scheduler since "First Contact," before you drive to pick your car up, call the Tesla delivery location's direct number, and verify that your car is indeed ready to go. There have been reports of people driving hours to pick up their Tesla only to be told their car isn't even in production yet!

1.  Have the Tesla app installed on your smartphone prior to arrival for delivery.
2.  Bring your driverâ€™s license.
3.  If your car will be registered to more than one person, each person on the registration needs to be at the delivery appointment to sign final documents.
4.  Bring written or digital proof of your down payment having been made and the final payment details or financing details.  If you are financing your car, make sure your loan has been funded before you arrive to take delivery and that you have some kind of proof you can provide to Tesla should they ask about it.
5.  Bring a printed insurance card or other proof of insurance that shows your Model 3 is insured.
6.  Since the delivery area where you will inspect your Model 3 may be dark, bring a flashlight.
7.  Bring a USB drive (32gb minimum recommended) to set up [Sentry mode and the dash cam](https://www.tesla.com/support/software-v9#dashcam).

### Arrival at the Delivery Center:
After checking in with a Tesla employee, you'll likely be waiting around for a while. It's rare for a Tesla delivery center to _not_ be busy. Expect to wait for 2 hours or more before you're taken to see your car.

*NOTE: Do not sign final documents, or wire funds, until a full vehicle inspection is completed.*

## Post-inspection:
### Verify post-delivery vehicle records
1.  Ask your delivery specialist to make sure that your car is marked as DELIVERED in Tesla's network. *NOTE: Some owners have reported cars being delivered, but the phone key is disabled the following day. This is due to the car not being marked as "Delivered" in the network.*

2.  Make sure you have copies of all paperwork necessary for good documentation of your purchase, including a copy of your signed purchase agreement (MVPA). If your delivery specialist suggests that you can get your documents electronically on your Tesla account, ask for paper copies you can take with you anyway. Having physical copies with you ensures you will get them.

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is has a reputation of rectifying these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a car you're not happy taking away that day, you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*

# Appendix
## Must-Have Accessories
After a year and a half of Model 3 ownership, here are the accessories I have found to be real upgrades that I haven't taken for granted:
1. All-weather floor mats [OEM (my recommendation)](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-all-weather-floor-liners), [aftermarket](https://www.amazon.com/3D-MAXpider-B07D9GMYG8?tag=mykelteslapre-20). I keep these in my car year-round. It has helped preserve the new car smell, and is easy to keep clean.
2. Wireless charging pad [OEM](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-wireless-phone-charger), [aftermarket](https://www.amazon.com/TapTes-Horizontally-Vertically-Smartphone-Compatible/dp/B07X2RJ2V4?tag=mykelteslapre-20). I have the aftermarket one installed in mine. No issues.
3. A fast-write [USB stick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CIEBS74?tag=mykelteslapre-20) for Sentry and dashcam footage. I recommend one with a built-in lightning port to easily review footage on your iPhone.
4. A [vinyl wrap](https://www.abstractocean.com/model-3-center-console-vinyl-wrap/) for the center console. The factory console is piano black, which is impossible not to scratch. Vinyl wraps are easy to install and (arguably) look better than stock.
